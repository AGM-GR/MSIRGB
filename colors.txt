It's actually possible to set 8 different colours, hence why I sometimes saw weird patterns of colours when testing. I never knew because Mystic Light transforms the R, G, B values into single byte, symmetric values - only supports 4 colours, and i.e. if requested colour 1 to be 210, 200, 49 (D2, C8, 31), it transforms the colour as such: (byte)((210/16) * 0x11111111) = DD, (byte)((200/16) * 0x11111111) = CC, (byte)((49/16) * 0x11111111) = 33, so doesn't take advantage of the eight possible colours

1a - f00 - very red
2b - 0f0 - very green
3c - 00f - very blue
4d - 0ff - very light blue
5e - ff0 - very yellow
6f - fff - very white
7g - f0f - very violet
8h - 000 - very nothing


F0 00 FF F0 0F 0F FF 00 00 FF 0F F0


Pattern is:

h
e, f
c, d
a, b
a
d, c
f, e
h, g
h
... ad infinitum



Also, maybe add aida64 support for temps, clocks, etc. for effects? maybe as an external module?
